Supplement to the manuscript 'Gating kinetics and pharmacological properties of small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels' by Ilsbeth G.M. van Herck, Vincent Seutin, Bo H. Bentzen, Neil V. Marrion and Andrew G. Edwards <br/>
DOI:

Repository contains three Jupyter notebooks: <br/>
Group-analysis will analyze single SK channel event traces per group (control, apamin and AP14145). <br/>
Patch-analysis will analyze single SK channel event traces with details linked to Table 1 in the manuscript. <br/>
DB_compile will compile a database and excel file with all results from patch analysis. <br/>
